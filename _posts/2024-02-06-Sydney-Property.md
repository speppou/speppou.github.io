title: Is Sydney's Property Market Really That Bad? An In-depth Analysis
categories: []
---

Being from Sydney, I am property obsessed. It must be something in the water as I am pretty sure all Sydneysiders are too. As a result, an almost daily conversation topic is about how unaffordable the property market has become and, as someone hoping to one day buy a property, I wanted to investigate this in a bit more detail (or at least have something interesting to say next time this topic invariably comes up). 

# Can the median income afford a median property?

This seems like a pretty good place to start as property is a ladder and so the median income should be able to afford the median property, right?

[According to the ABS](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/earnings-and-working-conditions/characteristics-employment-australia/aug-2023), the median income in greater Sydney was $1,686.6 per week in Aug 2023. If we take affordable to mean that you are spending 30% of your income on housing (i.e., you're on the edge of meeting the definition of [mortgage stress](https://wayforward.org.au/debt-information/what-is-mortgage-stress-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/)), then we can see if the median person or median couple (defined as two median incomes) can afford the median house. In these calculations, we are assuming that the imaginary buyer has a 20% deposit and are paying a rate of 6.2% (a typical rate in Feb 2024).

From the graph below, we see that the median person in Sydney cannot afford the median property, but the median couple can almost afford the median property. At first, I was a little surprised by the fact that two people on the median income can almost afford the median property given the rhetoric about how unaffordable Sydney is. But, on reflection, this might be the *ladder* nature of property displaying itself coupled with the fact that dual income households are the norm.

## Houses vs units

Of course, not all property is created equal with houses being much more desirable than units, so how does affordability change when looking specifically at houses vs units? 

Well, what we see is the median person still cannot afford anything and that the median couple can afford slightly better than the median unit but is a long way off affording the median house.

# Where can the median income afford to buy?

Sydney is big. It is almost absurd how long it can take to travel from one side of the city to the other and being so large there are definitely more desirable areas than others. 

To see where in Sydney is affordable, I calculated the proportion of properties sold in each postcode which are affordable for either one or two median incomes (again, looking at repayments only). 

What the next few figures show is that all the talk about the "latte line" or "Red Rooster line" or "El Jannah line" might be irrelevant when you have access to property sales data to truly look at the divide between Sydney and Western Sydney. These figures all use a diverging colour palette so are easily read with red colours showing areas with less than 50% properties being affordable and blue areas having more than 50% properties being affordable.

Unsurprisingly, almost the entire map is red for a single median income. Surprisingly there are exactly two postcodes affordable to a single median income: Lakemba (2195) and Menangle Park (2563). So, if you are a median Sydneysider looking to buy a place by yourself then my advice is to start looking around Lakemba.

For two median incomes, the results will come to no surprise to most people that the eastern suburbs, northern beaches, north shore and parts of the inner west are largely unaffordable. 

## Houses vs units

I think it is interesting to look at the locations of affordable house vs units for two median incomes as I think it really tells an interesting story. 

Firstly, looking at units, the map is mostly blue meaning that two median incomes an afford a unit in most of the city except for the eastern suburbs, north shore and riverside inner west. I think a pretty good rule of thumb here is that two median incomes can afford a unit as long as it’s not near water or fancy private schools.

For houses, the story is very different with the majority of houses being unaffordable for two median incomes in almost all of the city except for the most far-flung postcodes.

# Property as an investment

To me this data is very demoralising. Houses in almost all of Sydney are unaffordable to most people. Units in suburbs where living in a unit is easy is also unaffordable. How is this possible? Surely there aren't that many rich parents buying their kids houses and foreign investors are there?

Well, Sydney (and Australia as a whole) is a bit strange in that your property is generally more than *just* where you live, it is also your biggest and often most successful investment. Now, this is of course a bit of a contentious topic given its basically impossible to truly cash out this investment because selling a home usually entails buying another home, but for the sake of this analysis, let’s assume we will treat property as an investment as well as a dwelling.  

In this case, affordable can mean that you spend 30% of your income on housing (like in the previous analyses) plus 20% of your income on investment. Except in this case all of that is going into your mortgage. 

Now, there are plenty of arguments against spending 50% of your income on housing and having your investments completely undiversified but let’s forget about all of those for now as I am sure plenty of people don’t see it that way. 

With 50% of your income going to service a mortgage, suddenly the prospects of owning look a lot better or both a double median income and a single median income.

</figure>

With this new paradigm where we treat property as an investment as well as well as a dwelling, it is starting to make more sense. A single median income can afford the median unit and two median incomes can afford more than the median house. What this tells us is that housing in Sydney is not treated just as housing, it is treated as your main investment, which means to keep up you have to also treat it as an investment and sink half of your pay into your mortgage if you want to keep up. 

How our hypothetical median couple saves 20% for the deposit in this scenario, I'm not sure. 

## Where can the median income afford to sink 50% of their income?

Of course, Sydney is not all equal and even sinking 50% of your income on your housing doesn't give you the right to live just anywhere in Sydney, especially if you want to live in a house.

Two median incomes spending 50% of their income on their mortgage can afford most of the units for sale in all postcodes except for the most desirable by the beach or harbour.

Unfortunately, for our imaginary median couple, even if the treat their house as their only investment, then they still shouldn’t dream about having a house in the eastern suburbs, northern beaches, north shore, northwest or the inner west.

# Final Thoughts

This was an interesting exercise and after looking at this data there are a few take aways for me: 

1. Sydney is not a good place to be single and a below median earner. We need more affordable housing initiatives and support for people leaving abusive relationships.
2. You must somewhat treat your property as an investment. This does seem a bit like a Ponzi scheme, so we have to hope Sydney's population doesn't decline in our lifetimes. 
3. Everything we looked at was for the median so that means there are 50% of people worse off than the picture painted here.
