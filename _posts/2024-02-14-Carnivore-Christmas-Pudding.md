Long before the idea of making a [meaty dessert]( https://surfacethoughts.com/Turkey-Ice-Cream/), there was the idea of making a dessert out of meat.

The idea is simple: if you squint both Christmas pudding and Christmas stuffing look about the same. Why not make one out of the other?

Unfortunately, I am writing this blog three years after making the thing, so I can’t go into too much detail or give a recipe. But what I can say is that pudding is a pretty standard turkey stuffing with cranberries, nuts, etc. so it was absolutely delicious. It was cooked in a bowl (maybe sous vide? I can’t remember) and then browned in the oven to give the perfect golden-brown colour of a pudding.
